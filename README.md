# NextNiche: an NLP-based job discovery tool

NextNiche is a tool designed to help job seekers discover new job titles and companies. 
Based on a user's text description of an ideal work environment, resulting job descriptions may help tailor future job searches.
This project was completed as part of the Insight Data Science Fall 2018 cycle. 

Webapp is built using Dash, spaCy, and Beautiful Soup.

Included in this repo are an app file and a data pipeline file. Use the pipeline file to scrape recent job descriptions and deploy the app.
